# achel-experimental

Stuff that isn't quite ready to be in the main achel repository.

The current focus is

 * The Achel functionality for Robotics. - There's about 13 years behind this. It's  based on the flow of data. Flexible and complex flows can be modeled quickly and easily.

*This is pre-alpha software. And not yet intented for mainstream use.*

# Attitude

In my earlier implementations, I tried to make the concept do everything that a traditional language could do. It become heavy long before becoming useful. This paradime offers some really cool possibilties and also some limitations which can be worked around. However it is generally much better when simply complimented with a more tradtional programming language. In this case Achel macros provide those foundations while this code can get on with what it is there to do.

# History, origin and purpose

In late 2001 there were a number of projects I wanted to build that weren't particularly well suited to traditional programming languages. So I started playing with the concept of flows of data and how you could dynamically manipulate them while live. In it's most basic sense, the concept isn't new. But here I am taking the concept to a level I've never seen before.
