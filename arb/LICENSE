The entirety of the sortware in this repository is currently available to the public under the GPL version 3.0 license included in the file named COPYING.

If this does not meet your needs, please get in touch and I'll see what I can do to accomodate you. If we do not explicitly come to an alternative arrangement, the GPL version 3.0 stands.
