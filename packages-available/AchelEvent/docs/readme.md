# AchelEvent

Triggers an event every time data is recieved. The event is triggered once per block of data rather than on every line. 

The intention with this is to trigger the event as often as required, while having the minimum number of extra triggers, and thus avoid wasting resources.

# Using it

TODO write this. See unit tests for now.
