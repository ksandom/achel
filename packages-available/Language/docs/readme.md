# Language

Provides the language constructs that don't need to be in the core.

## Using it

* Make sure `Language` is included via [repoParms](https://github.com/ksandom/achel/blob/master/docs/programming/creatingARepositoryWithProfiles.md#use-repoparmdefinepackages-to-create-a-profile). If BASE is included, it should be fine.
* All the `Language` functionality should then be able to be used.
