# Hash

Provides features for hashing data.

For now this is just CRC and is basically intended for doing things like consistently choosing a color for different values. Soon more hashing algorythims will be added and this will become more complete.

## Using it

* Make sure `Hash` is included via [repoParms](https://github.com/ksandom/achel/blob/master/docs/programming/creatingARepositoryWithProfiles.md#use-repoparmdefinepackages-to-create-a-profile). If BASE is included, it should be fine.
* Get a data set.
* Do some manipulations on it.
