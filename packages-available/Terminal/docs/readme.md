# Terminal

Provides functionality for opening terminal windows.

Right now this is intended for application usage inside tui (soon to be released) rather than user usage. It will later provide more functionality that will be interesting in other situations.

## Using it

* Make sure `Terminal` is included via [repoParms](https://github.com/ksandom/achel/blob/master/docs/programming/creatingARepositoryWithProfiles.md#use-repoparmdefinepackages-to-create-a-profile). If BASE is included, it should be fine.

More documentation to come here when it becomes relevant.

## A worked example

    # Open a terminal window with top running in it. ~ top,example
    
    spawnTerminal top
