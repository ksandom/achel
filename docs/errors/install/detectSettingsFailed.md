# Detecting old settings failed

This happens when an existing achel installation is detected, but doesn't appear to be healthy. While the install may be able to pull out the correct settings, it's a risky task since there are many ways this situation can occur, some of them worse than others.

Allowing the install to continue because ignoring the previous settings altogether should resolve this problem. If it doesn't please raise a bug.
