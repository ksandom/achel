# Detecting old settings failed

It is safe to press CTRL+C here if you want more time to read.

This happens when an existing achel installation is detected, but doesn't appear to be healthy. While the install may be able to pull out the correct settings, it's a risky task since there are many ways this situation can occur, some of them worse than others.

My recommendation is to continue the install. Everything that is a likely cause of this problem is covered by the install process.
