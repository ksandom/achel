# devFolder

The devFolder is where any repositories will be cloned to.

It is strongly recommended that all development is done outside of where Achel is installed. This is so you can thoroughly test the installation of your application without having to worry about loosing any uncommitted work.

This defaults to your current directory, so if you are having trouble setting it as desired, you can simply make sure you are in the correct folder before starting the wizard.

Let's say you have chosen a name earlier of "bobsWigets". A sensible path could be /home/user/Documents/development/bobsWigets.
