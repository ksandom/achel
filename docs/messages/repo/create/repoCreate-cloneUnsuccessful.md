# Clone unsuccessful

It looks like the clone didn't work. If you got an error like

    ERROR: Repository not found.

The chances are that it's a mistake on your part. Check

* The URL issued by the host.
* That the way you are authenticating against the host has sufficient permissions to clone the repository.

If you see an error about a timeout, it could go either way. Check

* The URL issued by the host.
* If the host is up. If you are using github you can check it [here](https://status.github.com/)
