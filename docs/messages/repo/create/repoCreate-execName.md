# execName

This is the command that users will type to execute the application. If you don't want an executable you can leave this blank. An example of when you would leave this blank is if your repository simply only adds functionality to another profile.

The execName should be short and easy to type and not conflict with any existing commands. This can be easier said than done, but please use some care to get something you're happy with.
