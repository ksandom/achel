# Backed up old files

One or more files have been backed up so they can be replaced. They will have had .old appended to their original name. Eg readme.md would have become readme.md.old.

As of this writing the following files get tested for

* README.md - The default readme that github puts in place when the repo is created. This can safely be deleted unless someone has put some useful information in there. If that is the case you will probably want to manually merge it into readme.md.
* readme.md - The readme that is generated for Achel repositories. The readme.md.old can be deleted unless someone has put some useful information in there. If that is the case you will probably want to manually merge it into readme.md.
* parameters.json - The repoParms parameters file that defines how the repository will be used. The easiest thing would be to manually replicate the settings you want rather than trying to merge the two files. For information in achieving the results you want, read [here](https://github.com/ksandom/achel/blob/master/docs/programming/creatingARepositoryWithProfiles.md).
