# repoURL

This is the URL from which the repository will be checked out. The wizard will take a *very* rough guess at what it might be based on your username on your local machine and the repo name you chose a few questions ago. This fits with my use-case, but may not fit anyone elses. Please check it with care.

* The repository that this URL represents should exist BEFORE completing this wizard.
* The repository should be initialised.
* For compatibility with the achelctl automation tools, it should not be HTTP based.
