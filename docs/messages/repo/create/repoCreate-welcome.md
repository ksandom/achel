# Create a repository

This wizard will guide you through creating a repository. No action will be taken until all the input tests pass. So you you can press CTRL + C any time before that without leaving things in a dirty state. If the tests don't pass, your previous answers will be remembered so you don't have to re-enter everything.

An item in square brackets [] is the default value. Pressing enter will accept that answer.

*This wizard makes a complicated process simple. Please read everything.*
