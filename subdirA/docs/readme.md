Welcome to the documentation. I hope you'll find it friendly and useful.

On a day-to-day basis `mass --help=searchTerm` should be your first point of call since that will always be the most up-to-date as it is syntactically required to create a feature. However the docs found here and within the packages (such as AWS) should give your a bigger picture view.

If you're starting out, you'll want install.md to get you up and running with data. (Even if you have it installed, you should take a look at this!) After that gettingStarted.md will give you a very basic jumpstart into using mass.

Once you're ready to do custom stuff, you'll want to check out the "creatingA" series. I recommend starting with creatingAPackage.md, which will save you much effort! And then move on to creatingAMacro.md and creatingATemplate.md.


If you spot a `TODO` in the documentation, you're welcome to fill it in. That would be very helpful!
