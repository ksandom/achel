# Build tools

This is a first go at some build automation. This will get replaced, but it is a starting point.

## Using/deploying it

TODO write this.

## Creating your own app

TODO write this.

## Building it

To build the latest code, run

```bash
./automation/build/dockerBuild
```

Then when you're happy with it, you can run

```bash
./automation/build/dockerPush
```
